index_home_text=Dawnswyr Tawerin are from Swansea.  Tawerin literally translates as the ‘folk of Swansea’, a very appropriate name for a Folk dancing team from Swansea. Tawerin was founded in 1975 by former members of the highly successful Swansea University. Our experienced team meets weekly in Hendy, and regularly competes at the National Eisteddfod and the Cerdd Dant Festival. We also enjoy travelling, especially to international festivals, in order to share our traditions with the rest of the world.

menu_info_dances=The Dances
info_dances_subtitle=Some of Tawerin’s Repertoire
info_dances_llanover_title=Llanover Reel
info_dances_llanover=A three handed reel performed at Llanover Court for the entertainment of Lady Llanover’s guests. Large Welsh households would traditionally have a resident harpist and this dance survived at the Court until the demise of the Llanover harpist in 1887.
info_dances_gower_title=Gower Reel
info_dances_gower=The Gower Reel was danced at Port Eynon on the iconic Gower Peninsula and is thus a dance local to Tawerin. It is a four handed reel stepping dance leading successively into Figure 8, bringing dancers into a different order and showing a complexity of steps. Traditional Welsh clogs may be worn for this dance.
info_dances_llantony_title=Llantony Abbey
info_dances_llantony=This dance takes its name from the beautiful Abbey at Llantony and is a Welsh social dance from a collection-dated c1825. It is a long ways three couple dance and is considered to have a quintessential Welsh Style.
info_dances_tycoch_title=Tŷ Coch Caerdydd
info_dances_tycoch=Many of the traditional Welsh dances were revived by Patrick Shaw. He later composed new dances based on these traditions, including this dance. It is again a three couple dance that won the composition prize at the 1966 National Eisteddfod. Tŷ Coch Caerdydd was dedicated by him to the Swansea University team who first performed this dance (they were founders of Tawerin). Given it’s obvious balance and symmetry it has become arguably the most popular of Welsh social dances and a definite favourite with Tawerin.
info_dances_sawdl_title=Sawdl y Fuwch
info_dances_sawdl=Another one of Patrick Shaw’s three couple dances. Again based on Welsh traditions and patterns, it features an attractive double hey complementing its complex figures based on the Llangadfan style, of mid Wales.
info_dances_powell_title=Powell’s Fancy
info_dances_powell=Known in Wales as 'Hoffedd ap Hywel', it was found in a 1765 dance manual. It was originally a triple minor long ways set, later it was adapted for three couples. It should be performed with vigour and energy to impress other dancers and show the dancers vitality.
info_dances_pont_title=Pont Cleddau
info_dances_pont=A late twentieth century dance composed to commemorate the construction of the Cleddau Bridge (which links the north and south of Pembrokeshire) a county in South West Wales. The first four figures depict different stages in its construction and the final figures show some water skiing around the abutments; and then all leading over the bridge. During the construction of the bridge a large section collapsed; this event occasionally happens during a performance - but not deliberately! ;-)
info_dances_meillionen_title=Meillionen
info_dances_meillionen=The dance literally takes its name from the Welsh name for a ‘Clover Leaf’, the shape of which is assumed during of the dance. This unusual dance was performed to a beautiful old tune, well known in Wales. It was published in 1735 and contains a cumulative type of hey found in older Tudor period dances. It is usually performed by five couples and was considered a dance for the more refined circles of society at the time.
info_dances_rhuddem_title=Rhuddem y Ddawns
info_dances_rhuddem=Literally, “Ruby of the Dance” written to commemorate the Fortieth Anniversary of a fellow Folk Dancing team (From Cardiff).  It is a delightful interpretation of a simple square set dance.
info_dances_nantgarw_title=The Fair Dances of Nantgarw
info_dances_nantgarw=These are a collection of seven dances from a cluster of villages in the Nantgarw, an area of South Wales. They are flamboyant and lively and were performed at hiring fairs and holidays, for the entertainment of the onlookers. Often after they had been persuaded by the dancers to pay with their hard earned wages to see the dances. They were danced up until the late 1880’s and were recorded from the living memory of Margaretta Thomas (daughter of the late Dr. Ceinwen Thomas) who recalled childhood memories of the dancers and dances she had loved to watch in the fairs:
info_dances_nantgarw_rali_title=Rali Twm Sion
info_dances_nantgarw_rali=Is a processional dance for 6 couples dressed in colourful costumes, caps and bells. The dance moves through many patterns, hey’s, blocks, circles; the vigorous movements both in turn threatening and amusing to the audience, at the end of which the dancers should have earned their performance fee
info_dances_nantgarw_ceiliog_title=Ceiliog y Rhedyn
info_dances_nantgarw_ceiliog=Named after the grasshopper which both men and women attempt to imitate throughout the dance. A four couple square set of which one of the notable features is when facing, the men attempt to out jump each other with their ‘grasshopper jumps’ across the set. Not a dance for the shy and reserved.
info_dances_nantgarw_gwylifan_title=Gŵyl Ifan
info_dances_nantgarw_gwylifan=The dance of Saint John’s Eve – a dance for mid summer, the women traditionally dressed in all white costumes. A four couple dance featuring open circles, weaves and lines of dancers which becomes progressively faster and faster as the men attempt to impress their partners with their prowess - not to be attempted by the faint hearted.
info_dances_president_title=The President’s collection
info_dances_president=Tawerin’s President, Mavis Williams Roberts has achieved huge respect in Folk Dance circles as a dancer, teacher and composer of dances. Her collection of dances has won National acclaim and she has added greatly to the repertoire of performance dance in Wales:
info_dances_president_cestyll_title=Cestyll yr Arglwydd Rhys
info_dances_president_cestyll=Named after the Castles of Lord Rhys of Deheubarth (a large area of South West Wales). In the twelfth century, Arglwydd Rhys resisted the Normans who had swept through all of England. The dance depicts this proud Prince travelling his lands and castles, imposing his will and dealing with any opposition; the dance ends with the Eisteddfod - a gathering of cultural events that Lord Rhys instigated and which still persists to this day (and it is one of Wales’s proudest traditions).
info_dances_president_ffairybala_title=Ffair y Bala
info_dances_president_ffairybala=The dance is based on the annual hiring fair in the North Wales town of Bala. Farming servants would come to the fair for a well-earned break, to look for a better master for the coming year and perhaps find a partner. The four couple dance sees the men and women vying for each other’s attention- and of course the outcome does not always go as expected.
info_dances_president_middleton_title=Middleton Hall
info_dances_president_middleton=Takes the name of the Hall, which once stood, in the grounds of the impressive National Botanic Garden of Wales. This four couple dance was commissioned to commemorate its official opening and has recently been accompanied by its sister dance, Llwybrau’r Ardd- ‘The Garden’s Walks’ -to celebrate its Tenth Anniversary.
